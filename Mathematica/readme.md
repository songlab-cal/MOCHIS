# MOment Computation and Hypothesis testing Induced by S<sub>n,k</sub> (MOCHIS)

This is the repository for organizing and distributing code and results related to the
family of spacing-statistics and their associated hypothesis test detailed in:

## Code

### mochis.nb

This is a Mathematica notebook to reproduce results and figures used in our main
manuscript, as well as to perform general one-sample and two sample tests. It contains functions for 

* computing the moment sequences associated with the weighted p-norms of S<sub>n,k</sub> and S<sub>k</sub>
* accurate evaluation of a distribution's CDF given its first m moments
* performing one- and two-sample tests
* optimizing parameter configurations (p, w) for power against any given set of alternative distributions
