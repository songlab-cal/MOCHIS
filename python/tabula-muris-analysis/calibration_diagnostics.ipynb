    "We simulate samples $(X,Y)$, with $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^k$ and $Y\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $k\\leqslant n$. We draw each element of $X$ and $Y$ from the same distribution to match the null hypothesis. By varying the values of $(k,n)$, we examine the control of Type I Error of MOCHIS. This also allows examination of the numerical performance of the various approximations (e.g., large $n$, large $n$ and $k$) described in the paper. "
